# Effective TypeScript Skill

Apply the 62 items from Dan Vanderkam's "Effective TypeScript" to review existing code and write new TypeScript. This skill operates in two modes: **Review Mode** (analyze code for violations) and **Write Mode** (produce idiomatic, well-typed TypeScript from scratch).

## Reference Files

This skill includes categorized reference files covering all 62 items:

- `ref-01-getting-to-know-ts.md` — Items 1-5: TS/JS relationship, compiler options, code generation, structural typing, any
- `ref-02-type-system.md` — Items 6-18: editor, sets, type vs value space, declarations vs assertions, object wrappers, excess property checking, generics, readonly, mapped types
- `ref-03-type-inference.md` — Items 19-27: inferable types, widening, narrowing, objects at once, aliases, async/await, context, functional constructs
- `ref-04-type-design.md` — Items 28-37: valid states, Postel's Law, documentation, null perimeter, unions of interfaces, string types, branded types
- `ref-05-working-with-any.md` — Items 38-44: narrowest scope, precise any variants, unsafe assertions, evolving any, unknown, monkey patching, type coverage
- `ref-06-type-declarations.md` — Items 45-52: devDependencies, three versions, export types, TSDoc, this in callbacks, conditional types, mirror types, testing types
- `ref-07-writing-running-code.md` — Items 53-57: ECMAScript features, iterating objects, DOM hierarchy, private, source maps
- `ref-08-migrating.md` — Items 58-62: modern JS, @ts-check, allowJs, module-by-module, noImplicitAny

## How to Use This Skill

**Before responding**, read the relevant reference files based on the code's topic. For a general review, read all files. For targeted work (e.g., type design), read the specific reference (e.g., `ref-04-type-design.md`).

## Mode 1: Code Review

When the user asks you to **review** existing TypeScript code, follow this process:

### Step 1: Read Relevant References
Determine which chapters apply to the code under review and read those reference files. If unsure, read all of them.

### Step 2: Analyze the Code
Before listing issues, first ask: **Is this code already applying Effective TypeScript principles?** Look for positive signals:
- Tagged unions with a discriminant field (Item 28/32)
- Branded types for nominal typing (Item 37)
- `unknown` for external data, narrowed before use (Item 42)
- Type assertions scoped inside well-typed wrapper functions (Item 40)
- `readonly` on fields/parameters (Item 17)
- `async`/`await` with typed return types (Item 25)
- TSDoc comments on public functions (Item 48)

**Key rule — Item 40 interaction with Item 9:** A type assertion (`as T`) inside a function that has a fully-typed signature is NOT a violation of Item 9. Item 40 explicitly endorses hiding unsafe assertions inside well-typed wrappers. Only flag `as` when it appears at a call-site or as an escape hatch on a public-facing value.

For each relevant item from the book, check whether the code follows or violates the guideline. Focus on:

1. **TypeScript Fundamentals** (Items 1-5): Is `strict` mode enabled? Is `any` used carelessly? Does structural typing cause surprises?
2. **Type System Usage** (Items 6-18): Are type declarations preferred over assertions? Are object wrapper types avoided? Are `readonly` and mapped types used appropriately?
3. **Type Inference** (Items 19-27): Is inference relied upon where possible? Are `async`/`await` used over callbacks? Are aliases consistent?
4. **Type Design** (Items 28-37): Do types represent only valid states? Are string types replaced with literal unions? Are null values pushed to the perimeter?
5. **Working with any** (Items 38-44): Is `any` scoped as narrowly as possible? Is `unknown` used for truly unknown values? Are unsafe assertions hidden in well-typed wrappers?
6. **Type Declarations** (Items 45-52): Are `@types` in devDependencies? Are public API types exported? Is TSDoc used for comments?
7. **Code Execution** (Items 53-57): Are ECMAScript features preferred over TypeScript-only equivalents? Is object iteration done safely?
8. **Migration** (Items 58-62): Is modern JavaScript used as a baseline? Is migration done module-by-module?

### Step 3: Calibrate Your Response

**If the code is already well-typed:**
- Open with acknowledgment of what is correct and which Items are applied
- Only note genuine issues; do not manufacture problems
- Any remaining observations must be clearly labeled as "optional polish" or "minor suggestion"
- Do NOT escalate a narrowly scoped assertion inside a well-typed function to Critical/Important

**If the code has real issues:**
For each issue found, report:
- **Item number and name** (e.g., "Item 9: Prefer Type Declarations to Type Assertions")
- **Location** in the code
- **What's wrong** (the anti-pattern)
- **How to fix it** (the TypeScript-idiomatic way)
- **Priority**: Critical (bugs/correctness), Important (maintainability), Suggestion (style)

### Step 4: Provide Fixed Code (only when needed)
If there are real issues, offer a corrected version with comments explaining each change. If the code is already correct, you may offer a brief "what's great here" summary instead of a rewrite.

## Mode 2: Writing New Code

When the user asks you to **write** new TypeScript code, apply these core practices:

### Always Apply These Core Practices

1. **Enable strict mode** (Item 2). Never write TypeScript without `"strict": true` in tsconfig.json.

2. **Prefer type declarations over assertions** (Item 9). Use `const x: MyType = value` not `const x = value as MyType`.

3. **Avoid object wrapper types** (Item 10). Use `string`, `number`, `boolean` — never `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`.

4. **Use types that represent only valid states** (Item 28). Eliminate impossible states at the type level with tagged unions.

5. **Push null to the perimeter** (Item 31). Don't scatter `T | null` throughout — handle nullability at boundaries.

6. **Prefer unions of interfaces to interfaces of unions** (Item 32). Model tagged unions instead of interfaces with optional fields that have implicit relationships.

7. **Replace plain string types with string literal unions** (Item 33). `type Direction = 'north' | 'south' | 'east' | 'west'` not `string`.

8. **Generate types from APIs and specs, not data** (Item 35). Use `quicktype` or OpenAPI code generation — don't hand-write types for external data.

9. **Use `unknown` instead of `any` for values with unknown type** (Item 42). `unknown` forces callers to narrow before use.

10. **Scope `any` as narrowly as possible** (Item 38). Apply it to a single value, never a whole object or module.

11. **Use `readonly` to prevent mutation bugs** (Item 17). Prefer `readonly` on function parameters accepting arrays, and on class fields that should not be reassigned.

12. **Use `async`/`await` over raw Promises and callbacks** (Item 25). It produces cleaner inferred types and clearer code.

13. **Use type aliases to avoid repeating yourself** (Item 14). DRY applies to types too — extract shared structure with `Pick`, `Omit`, mapped types.

14. **Export all types that appear in public APIs** (Item 47). Don't force users to reconstruct types with `ReturnType<>` or `Parameters<>`.

15. **Use TSDoc for API comments** (Item 48). `/** */` comments appear in editor tooltips; `@param`, `@returns`, `@deprecated` are recognized by tooling.

### Type Structure Template

```typescript
// Prefer interfaces for object shapes (extendable); type aliases for unions/intersections
interface User {
  readonly id: UserId;     // Item 17: readonly on fields that shouldn't change
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Branded type for nominal typing (Item 37)
type UserId = string & { readonly __brand: 'UserId' };

// Tagged union — only valid states representable (Item 28, 32)
type RequestState<T> =
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success'; data: T }
  | { status: 'error'; message: string };

// unknown, not any, for values from external sources (Item 42)
function parseResponse(json: string): unknown {
  return JSON.parse(json);
}

// async/await over callbacks (Item 25)
async function fetchUser(id: UserId): Promise<User> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
  return response.json() as User; // narrowly scoped assertion inside well-typed function (Item 40)
}
```

### any Guidelines
- If `any` is unavoidable, apply it to the smallest possible scope (Item 38)
- Prefer `unknown` for values received from external sources (Item 42)
- Hide unsafe assertions inside well-typed wrapper functions (Item 40)
- Track type coverage with `type-coverage` CLI to prevent regressions (Item 44)

## Priority of Items by Impact

### Critical (Correctness & Bugs)
- Item 2: Enable `strict` mode — `noImplicitAny` and `strictNullChecks` prevent whole classes of bugs
- Item 9: Prefer declarations to assertions — **but see Item 40**: assertions inside well-typed wrappers are fine
- Item 28: Types that always represent valid states — impossible states cause runtime errors
- Item 31: Push null to the perimeter — scattered nullability causes null dereferences
- Item 42: Use `unknown` instead of `any` — `any` silently disables type checking

> **Item 40 exception:** `raw as SomeType` inside a function with a fully-typed signature is explicitly endorsed by Item 40. It is acceptable and should NOT be flagged as a Critical or Important violation. At most, note it as a minor optional polish item (suggest a runtime validator like zod as a complement).

### Important (Maintainability)
- Item 13: Know the differences between `type` and `interface`
- Item 14: Use type operations and generics to avoid repetition
- Item 17: Use `readonly` to prevent mutation bugs
- Item 25: Use `async`/`await` over callbacks
- Item 32: Prefer unions of interfaces to interfaces of unions
- Item 33: Prefer string literal unions over plain `string`
- Item 47: Export all types that appear in public APIs
- Item 48: Use TSDoc for API comments

### Suggestions (Polish & Optimization)
- Item 19: Omit inferable types to reduce clutter
- Item 35: Generate types from APIs and specs
- Item 37: Consider brands for nominal typing
- Item 44: Track type coverage
- Item 53: Prefer ECMAScript features over TypeScript-only equivalents
